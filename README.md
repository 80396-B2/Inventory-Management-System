# Inventory-Management-System
This a Inventory Management system  created using python 3.9 and its various modules & libraries.
This system can be preferably used in a pharmaceutical store or a website of a pharmaceutical company(like medplus).
# Getting Started
You need to have a python platform on your system.
* Download all the files in your pc but make sure to keep all of them in the exact same folder else the code will not execute.
* Later, hit run and the code will start executing.
# Modules/Libraries used
The python libraries I used are:-
* json
* datetime
* time
* random
# Features
* It can check the availability of the ordered drug and will reply as per the stock.
* It has a prescription checker to check if the drug can be sold over the counter or not for legal restrictions.
* It comes with a bill at the end which is quite detailed,compact and eye-catching
* You can also check the after sales record in the sales.json file.
# Special facts
* All the bill number are completely random and unique.
* On the bill you can find your name, exact time of check-out and the present date!!
# Data set
I myself created the data set using dictionary in python then converted it in Json.
It has 30 products and each product has 7 attributes/properties:-
* Drug name
* Expiry date
* Price
* Country of origin
* Over the counter permission
* Bar code no
* Quantity available
* mg(power)
* Unique item code
All the names of drug are real and legit though their attributes are all made-up by me..
